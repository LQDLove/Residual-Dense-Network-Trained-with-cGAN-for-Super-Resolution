# Residual-Dense-Network-Trained-with-cGAN-for-Super-Resolution
This repository is as a research project in the field of super resolution. It uses RDN as the generator and spectral norm is used in discriminator.

# Introduction
### This is a trial for super-resolution
The residual dense network has many advantages for reconstructing SR images, and we use GANs to enhance RDN.
The core idea is from the following two paper:
1. Residual Dense Network for Image Super-Resolution
2. cGANs with projection discriminator
##### Generator: Residual Dense Network

##### Discriminator: cGAN projection
